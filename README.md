# UCLA Class Scraper

`class-scraper-rs` contains a library which reads your DARS report and parses it into
a list of classes you still need to take.

## Future functionality:

- making more requests to get prereqs of classes

Additionally this repo contains class-list-hs which is a haskell reimplementation for fun of https://github.com/JOC9000/personal-projects/tree/main/UCLA-class-selector
